E.g. the questions on how much of a threat certain media/platforms/actors are do not account for the fact that misinformation can be a problem in any medium of communication, and what matters is how people interact with that medium and what information is propagated on it and how. Moreover, large-network influencers including celebrities, high-profile media personalities and politicians, as well as disinformation agents and foreign states, are the most problematic actors for spreading misinformation, but only a small minority of them - it was not possible to communicate this given the design of the survey (except by answering 'moderate'). Finally, it would be very useful to ask what researchers think the best way of addressing the problem is, i.e. what type of regulatory and policy approaches should be pursued (especially given the need to account for freedom of expression). There is a great deal of excellent research on the policy, legal and governance aspects of what is in essence a policy problem rather than a technical one, including by IPIE associates, yet the IPIE seems to ignore this research in its surveys and overviews.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the question seems clearly written by quantitative researchers tendentiously seeking to show that other researchers in this area have misconceptions about misinformation. Such gotcha questions hinge on definitions of misinformation which - as one of the authors of this survey knows and has published on previously - are not universal. In particular, whether we are talking about the overall phenomenon of ""information disorder/distortion"" vs false (or misleading) information is crucial.

Secondly, many of the questions asked about the importance of AI or other issues hinge on context, something that is not captured in this survey. For example, in some communities, especially immigrants, I am particularly worried about the influence of WhatsApp and other p2p messaging apps. But I'm not worried about them for the rest of the US-based population. Makes it difficult to generalize in answering your survey. 

Third, for those who study the Middle East, there is no geographic category we can check except for North Africa and Western Asia (which includes countries that don't fall under this rubric). In the future, considering UN regional definitions may be more helpful than arbitrary and non-standard geographic regions.","Gift Claimed","Jun 14, 2024 10:05 AM EDT","CAD32.71 Amazon Canada","Jun 14, 2024 10:34 AM EDT","Approved"

thank you for sending over the questionnaire, I am sure this will become a valuable research resource. I did struggle with the lack of nuance in some questions, specially the one about how different types of platforms affect the information environment. That is because the platform function, or business models per se, would not be enough for me to weigh in this question, with other variables being more important (like whether there is regulatory framework or not; if they employ content moderation and how; and so on). In any case, I hope my answers are helpful and wish you all the best for the project. 
Best regards,
